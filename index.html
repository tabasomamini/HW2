    <p id="a4" style="font-family: Forte;">Avatar: The Last Airbender is a 2022 American science fiction epic film produced and directed by James Cameron, who wrote the screenplay with Rick Yaffa and Amanda Silver from a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno.  Distributed by 20th Century Studios, the film is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second installment in the Avatar film series.  Actors Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Long, Joel David Moore, CH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dilip Rao and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, and Sigourney Weaver returns in a recurring role.[6]  Actors.  The story follows a blue-skinned Na'vi humanoid named Jake Sully (Worthington) as he and his family, threatened by humanity again, take refuge on the blue Metakaina clan of Pandora, a habitable exomoon where they live.<br>
        Cameron said in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it were successful, and he announced the first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for a 2014 release.[7][8] However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five Avatar films, and the necessity to develop new technology to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, preproduction, and visual effects.[9] The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with a currently untitled third film, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to Wellington on September 25, 2017, which ended in late September 2020 after three years of shooting. With an estimated budget of $350–460 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.
        After repeated delays in release, Avatar: The Way of Water premiered at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on December 6, 2022, and was released in the United States on December 16. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the visual effects and technical achievements but criticized the plot and lengthy runtime.[10] It was a major box office success, breaking multiple records, and grossing $2.32 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, the highest-grossing film since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named The Way of Water one of the top-ten films of 2022. Among its many accolades, the film was nominated for four awards at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Visual Effects. Three further sequels are in production, with the next film set to be released in December 2025.</p>
